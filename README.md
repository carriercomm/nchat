# NChat

Built with the intent of being a very basic, but easy to use chat application. Since it is so easy to spin up servers, you can quickly change urls or ports with a few changes. No database is required and it can be run directly from terminal. (only tested on OSX for now).

This uses [socket.io](http://socket.io/) for connecting and [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) for the skinning.
